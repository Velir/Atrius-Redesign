# Theme - Foundation Module

## Overview

This module contains functionality to theme components or sites.

## Features

### Color Pairs

The Color Pair item allows content authors to define backgound and foreground (i.e. text) colors to be used by components to alter the look and feel.  This provides the flexibility to author to be able to select a from a number of color options while allowing reuse across sites while still maintaining the integrity of the design.  With this, valid colors and color combinations can be setup on a per-site basis.

See the **Banners** Feature module for examples of this in use.
